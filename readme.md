# Assignment #5 - REST APIs

For this assignment, the web based routing has been removed and the root directory modified to render the index.html file that has the testing API application.

The testing API works similarly to what was shown in the class video.  However, I modified the index.html and client side JS to append the results of the tests to the bottom of the html.

The console will continue to log all of the original information, but for reference, key results of the each test are shown on the index.html file.

I added extensive error handling to the new class in the controller as well as the API routing.  Additional work is needed to create a better user message / experience which will occur as the project continues to grow.  For now, I wanted to capture errors to the source for troubleshooting purposes.
